# Circuit Netlists Extraction From Schematic Images

In our project, we want to build a system that can extract circuit netlists from schematic images. Circuit schematics are widely used in academic/professional work such as in datasheets, journal articles, documentation, and hardware manuals as well as in educational settings such as lecture slides, problem sets, lab manuals, whiteboards, and student notebooks. Being able to easily translate an image of a circuit schematic into a digital netlist that a professional or student can interact with using a simulation or design tool would bridge the gap in understanding as seamlessly as possible. This task requires the use of many fundamental image processing techniques that are part of the course and some other topics in traditional image processing and computer vision outside the course. In the end, we hope to present a tool that implements the processing and algorithms needed for a user to convert an image into a simple existing netlist format easily.
